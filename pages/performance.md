Our performances are designed to emulate the invisible and invasive nature of online tracking practices that underpin most online services.
Data brokers, advertisers, political actors, and other entities silently gather and trade our data. While this enables us to enjoy digital services free of charge, we yield control over intimate data that is leveraged to create detailed profiles of our psyche, preferences, and behaviors. Are we willing to become complicit accomplices in our targeting with tailored information designed to influence our choices and opinions? 

We aim to make an impact at public conferences, fairs, and festivals. By performing at events touching on critical art, civic discourse, public policy, and digital transformation, we seek to engage with policymakers while simultaneously sensitizing diverse audiences to the risks and pitfalls of unregulated digital services and infrastructure.

During our interventions, unsuspecting attendees are drawn in by the offer of a free gift, a seemingly innocent gesture. By accepting, they unknowingly consent to become "quantified entities." As they move through the event, a network of volunteers discreetly observes and tracks their activities, mirroring the pervasive surveillance of the digital realm. Absorbed in the event, participants remain unaware of this data collection until a revealing encounter with a tracking volunteer exposes the depth of intimate knowledge gathered. This revelation is intended to provoke discomfort, challenging participants to confront unsettling truths and misconceptions about privacy. 

Our ultimate goal is to foster a critical view of personal data sharing and encourage the reclamation of digital sovereignty and agency.
